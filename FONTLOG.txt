FONTLOG
Hispa
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Hispa family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Hispa fonts and
any derivative works.

The Hispa family of fonts supports the Toto script. This is currently
a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are preliminary
and incomplete. They should not be used for creating derivatives until
a later release.

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Serif Pro fonts
(https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro). The Toto glyphs are
designed by Jordan Bell.

For copyright and licensing information - including any Reserved Font
Names - see OFL.txt.

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this
font see OFL-FAQ.txt.

For information on contributing to this project see

# Hispa

The Hispa family of fonts supports the Toto script. This is currently a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are preliminary and incomplete. They should not be used for creating derivatives until a later release.

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed [Source Serif Pro fonts](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro). The Toto glyphs are
designed by Jordan Bell.

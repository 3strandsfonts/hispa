# Shimenkan

The Shimenkan family of fonts supports the broad variety of writing systems that use the Miao (Pollard) script. This is currently a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are preliminary and incomplete. They should not be used for creating derivatives until a later release.

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Sans Pro fonts (https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro). The Miao glyphs are designed to harmonize with the Latin, but remain true to the unique characteristics of Miao writing systems. The project is inspired by, but not based on, the Miao Unicode project (https://github.com/phjamr/MiaoUnicode).
